## üß† OVERVIEW

This guide walks through how to convert raw GA4 events into a functional monitoring setup.  
Focus is on SIGNAL site use-case: HTML-only site with `.txt` files, method pages, and tracked links.

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 1 ‚Äî ENABLE GOOGLE ANALYTICS 4 (GA4)

Already done in previous steps:
- GA4 property created
- Global Site Tag installed on every `.html`
- Inline events added for:
  - method_open
  - download_click
  - video_open
  - signal_step
  - cta_clicked

No further tag work required for monitoring setup.

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 2 ‚Äî VERIFY EVENTS ARE FIRING

1. Go to https://analytics.google.com/
2. Select property: `kay-test-eng`
3. Navigate: **Reports ‚Üí Realtime**
4. Open site in separate tab ‚Üí Click through:
   - Method case
   - Download `.txt`
   - Video guide
5. Confirm events show up:
   - `page_view`
   - `download_click`
   - `method_open`
   - `video_open`
   - `signal_step` (if used)

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 3 ‚Äî CREATE CUSTOM EVENT REPORT

1. In GA4, click: **Reports** (left sidebar)
2. Click: **Library** (bottom of reports list)
3. Under Collections, click: **+ Create new report**

Report Type: **Events**

4. Choose dimension: `event_name`  
   ‚Üí Add as primary dimension

5. Click ‚ÄúAdd metric‚Äù:
   - `event count`
   - `engagement time`
   - `users`

6. Save as:  
   `üîé SIGNAL Events Summary`

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 4 ‚Äî BUILD A CUSTOM DASHBOARD (EXPLORATIONS)

1. Go to: **Explore ‚Üí Blank**
2. Title: `SIGNAL Activity Map`

### Step 4.1 ‚Äî Set Dimensions
Click ‚Äú+‚Äù next to Dimensions ‚Üí Import:

- `page_path`
- `event_name`
- `event count`
- `link_text` (if applicable)
- `page_title`

### Step 4.2 ‚Äî Add Rows and Columns
Rows: `event_name`  
Columns: `page_path`  
Values: `event count`

This shows which events happened on which page.

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 5 ‚Äî FILTER FOR DOWNLOADS / METHODS

In your `SIGNAL Activity Map`:

- Click ‚ÄúFilter‚Äù ‚Üí Add:
  - Include event_name = `download_click`
  - Include event_name = `method_open`

Save filter set as:  
üì¶ `Action Events Only`

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 6 ‚Äî SET EMAIL ALERTS (Optional)

GA4 does not support native alert emails for custom events.  
Use third-party add-ons or connect BigQuery to enable this.

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 7 ‚Äî CREATE SHORTCUT LINKS FOR MONITORING

In GA4 interface:

- Open your custom report or dashboard
- Copy full URL from browser
- Save it to your local system dashboard (or GitHub `/docs/monitoring-links.txt`)

## üß© SUGGESTED MONITORING CHECKPOINTS

| Metric                | Check Frequency | Goal                             |
|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Unique page views     | Weekly           | Track reach of method cases      |
| Download clicks       | Daily (post-drop)| Measure config uptake            |
| Video opens           | Weekly           | Track guide usage post-deploy    |
| Custom event spikes   | Live (Realtime)  | Signal response after post-drop  |
| Drop-off pages        | Monthly          | UX failures in signal chain      |

---

## üß† FUTURE UPGRADE OPTIONS

- Connect GA4 to BigQuery ‚Üí build real dashboards in Looker Studio
